If there is a button with the name of a key (e.g. enter, WASD) USUALLY it will be bound to that keypress. (new thing is the exception)

If you're confused and stuck in a tunnel, here's help:

  You are X, don't get caught by λ. You need to guide λ to the yellow goal tile. Use WASD to move X, λ will always go towards you, and can move diagonally. You can't move diagonally. Click tiles to place walls. Nothing can get through walls. Not λ, not X. You can place walls ON λ or X, though. Placing a wall on λ does nothing, placing a wall on X makes you invincible, basically. You can't get got. All locations are possible to get the λ to, but some are trickier than others. Oh, except the top-right corner if there is water blocking it. Water is like natural walls.
