HOME PAGE:
  disabled:hover shows text. (zoom recommended)
  Click "Navbar" to get # in url, and "Search" to get ? in url. Necessary
    steps for some reason I can't control.

SELECTOR:
  Underlines are useful!

TIC TAC TOE:
  A light gray border appears at the bottom when a game finishes... I wonder
    what could be inside?

SELECTOR:
  Case sensitive!

SELECTOR - GAME:
  This is a classic peg jumping game. jump the pegs ("x"s) over each other
    until there is only one left.

NEW THING:
  "title" refers to <title>. (tab)
  Again, underlines are useful. (Other codes will help later, see the NEW THING near the end for that if you're stuck)

SELECTOR:
  Other codes still don't help. Old ones do, though.

SELECTOR:
  Case sensitive!

TIC TAC TOE:
  Back to the Selector

TUNNEL:
  Get to 10, then keep doing actions and wait for the random chance to kick
    in. (holding down a W, A, S, or D will help, and it will take a while)
  Click it.

SANDBOX:
  No secrets here. Just a sandbox. :)

NEW THING:
  Here's where the other code comes in. (Right here. On this page.)

MINESWEEPER:
  No secrets here. That's it.
