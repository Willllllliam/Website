My Website for all my projects

(In other words, PLEASE don't look in secrets. There is nothing of value there unless you 1: don't want to search for the secrets (tbf they are quite obscurely hidden) and 2: want to see random things I made in high school for fun. If you do look try not to ruin any fun for others)
